# Places Around Me
## AIM:
To develop a website to display details about the places around my house.

## Design Steps:

### Step 1: HTML Document Structure:
Use the !DOCTYPE html declaration to specify the document type. Open the html tag. Inside the html tag, add a title tag to set the title of the page. Close the html tag.

### Step 2: Body Section:
Open the body tag. Add an h1 tag for the heading. Insert an img tag with the src attribute pointing to an image file, and use the usemap attribute to associate an image map.

### step 3: Image Map:
Define a map tag with the name attribute set to "image_map." Inside the map tag, use tags to define clickable areas on the image. Each area tag should have attributes like alt, title, href, coords, and shape to specify the details of the clickable area.

### step 4: Close HTML Tags:
Close the body tag. Optionally, close the HTML document. These steps outline the basic structure of my HTML program with an image map.

### step 5:
End program.
